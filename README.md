Please do not start producing my modules as clones for resale, if you see someone producing my modules for resale please do not buy from them, if you buy a module made by someone else please do not ask me to provide support for them. If people abuse the open source licence I will stop releasing my designs.

If going over my circuits helps you design your own modules, including taking parts of the circuit and using them in your own designs, that is totally fine by me. Use your best judgement as to whether or not you are just recreating my module, if you are at all unsure go ahead and send me an email I usually respond quickly.

If you are building this module for your own use please know that I can not guarantee that the module will work as intended and I claim no responsibility to support the module or the build process. However if you have questions feel free to get in touch via the contact form on my website with the understanding that I am providing my help on my own time so be nice you know?
